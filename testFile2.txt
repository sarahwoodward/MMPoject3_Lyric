We are the champions, my friends.
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Don't stop believin'.
Hold on to the feelin'.
Streetlights people.

Carry on my wayward son.
For there'll be peace when you are done.
Lay your weary head to rest.
Don't you cry no more.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin.
Then you'll begin to make it better.

Shook me all night long.
Yeah you shook me all night long.

Woah, we're half way there.
Woah, livin' on a prayer.
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear.
Woah, livin' on a prayer.

Walk this way, walk this way.
Walk this way, walk this way.
Walk this way, walk this way.
Walk this way, walk this way.
Ah, just give me a kiss.

Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can.
And when it's time for leavin'.
I hope you'll understand.
That I was born a ramblin' man.

Bye, bye Miss American Pie.
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry.
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye.
Singin' this'll be the day that I die.
This'll be the day that I die.

No sugar tonight in my coffee.
No sugar tonight in my tea.
No sugar to stand beside me.
No sugar to run with me.

Pleased to meet you.
Hope you guess my name.
But what's puzzling you.
Is the nature of my game.

You can't start a fire.
You can't start a fire without a spark.
This gun's for hire.
Even if we're just dancing in the dark.

If we could take the time.
To lay it on the line.
I could rest my head.
Just knowin' that you were mine.
All mine.
So if you want to love me.
Then darlin' don't refrain.
Or I'll just end up walkin'.
In the cold November rain.

The people of the town are strange.
And they're proud of where they came.
Well, you're talkin bout china grove.
Oh, china grove.

What you say about his company.
Is what you say about society.
Catch the mist, catch the myth.

Gonna write me up a 125.
Post my face wanted dead or alive.
Take my license, all that jive.
I can't drive 55! Oh No!

Don't bring me down, groos.
Don't bring me down, groos.
Don't bring me down, groos.
Don't bring me down.

We're flirtin' with disaster,
Ya'll know what I mean.
And the way we run our lives,
It makes no sense to me.
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah.
When we gamble with our time,
We choose our destiny.

The jig is up, the news is out.
They finally found me.
The renegade who had it made.
Retrieved for a bounty.
Nevermore to go astray.
This'll be the end today.
Of the wanted man.

I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
But I can't find my way home.
Still I can't find my way home.

We're an American band.
We're an American band.
We're comin' to your town.
We'll help you party it down.
We're an American band.

Just hold on loosely.
But don't let go.
If you cling too tight babe.
You're gonna loose control.
Your baby needs someone to believe in.
And a whole lot of space to breathe in.
Don't let her slip away.

Saying oh yeah.
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.
Sayin' oh yeah.
Life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.
Now walk on.

In and around the lake.
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there.
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you.
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too.
Twenty four before my love you'll see.
I'll be there with you.

My mother, she was a tailor.
Sewed these new bluejeans.
My father was a gamblin' man.
Way down in New Orleans.
My mother, she would look at me.
She said, son, you've got a long road ahead.
Son, some may roll and make you crazy.
But don't forget these words I said.
And don't forget what your name is.
And know what the game is.
From the North coast to the South coast.
From country to country.
Mind to mind.
Generation to generation.
From time to time.
And to sniff across your mind.
To go downtown.
And to hang around.
The House of The Rising Sun.
Mother was a tailor.
Sewed these new blue-jeans.
Father was a gamblin' man, yea yea.
Way down, way down, in New Orleans.
And the only thing a gambling man needs.
Is some cash, ooh lord, and a trunk.
And the only time he's satisfied, ya ya.
Is when he's on some form of drug.
Ya-aah, board and bought, oh no.
To where, I do belong.
I'm wandering back.
To earn my pays, in The House.
They call, the Rising Sun.
Mother tell your baby children, yea yea.
Don't do the things that I've done.
Spend your life in sin and misery.
In The House, they call, the Rising Sun.
Ohh.
House, of The Rising, Sun.

Bang a gong.
Get it on.
Get it on.
Bang a gong.
Get it on.
