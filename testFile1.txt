You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat.
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes.
Then the sun die, the night is young though.
The diamonds still shine in the rough, hoe.
What the fuck though? Where the love go?.
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?.
It's a shit show, put you front row.
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show.
Money over bitches, and above hoes.
That is still my favorite love quote.
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?.
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore.
What the fuck yo? Where the love go?.
Trade the ski mask, for the muzzle.
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?.
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go.
If she's iffy, there the drugs go.
If she sip lean, double cup toast.
I got a duffle full of hundos.
There the love go, where's the uproar?.
What the fuck though? Where the love go?.
Five, four, three, two, I let one go.
Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro.
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo.
What the fuck though? Where the love go?.
Five, four, three, two, I let one go.
Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro.
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo.
Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro.
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, bro.
Puff, puff, bro, I don't huff though.
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke.
At your front door with a gun stowed.
"Knock-knock, who's there" is how it won't go.
This the jungle so have the utmost.
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so.
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro.
We grew up fast, we rolled up slow.
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope.
Dreadlock, hang time like yuh dun kno.
Put the green in the bag, like a lawnmower .
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow.
Extra clip in the stash like a console.
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Don O.
What the fuck bro? Where the love go?.
Swizzy, you the chef, I like my lunch gross.
Just look up, bro there the Scuds go.
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go? Mm.
To the unknown.
Only way he comin' back is through his unborn.
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord.
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?.
What the fuck though? Where the love go?.
Five, four, three, two, I let one go.
Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro.
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo.
What the fuck though? Where the love go?.
Five, four, three, two, I let one go.
Bow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro.
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo.
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh ooh.
Ayy, ayy.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Needless to say, I keep her in check.
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless yeah.
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck wreck.
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck wreck.
Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check.
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless.
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck.
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck.
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip.
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip.
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt.
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt.
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse.
She wanna ride me like a cruise.
And I'm not tryna lose.
Then you're left in the dust.
Unless I stuck by ya.
You're a sunflower.
I think your love would be too much.
Or you'll be left in the dust.
Unless I stuck by ya.
You're the sunflower.
You're the sunflower.
Every time I'm leavin' on ya.
You don't make it easy, no, no.
Wish I could be there for ya.
Give me a reason to go.
Every time I'm walkin' out.
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around.
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down.
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh.
I know you're scared of the unknown known.
You don't wanna be alone alone.
I know I always come and go and go.
But it's out of my control.
And you'll be left in the dust.
Unless I stuck by ya.
You're a sunflower.
I think your love would be too much.
Or you'll be left in the dust.
Unless I stuck by ya.
You're the sunflower.
